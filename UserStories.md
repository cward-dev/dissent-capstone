# User Stories



Anonymous User
*  As an anonymous user I would like to be able to read the main post, see comments on the main post and subposts. I would also like to see sub-posts. I can see the data of each post however, I cannot interact with the data.

Registered User
* As a registered user I would like to be able to do everything an anonymous user can, but also make comments of my own. I want my comments to be logged so I can look back at past ones, and view my aggregate data (rating/scores). I also want to be able to tag othersâ€™ comments and respond to them. Finally, I want to be able to have a profile of my own, with a unique username and picture of my choosing, and a bio if I choose to fill one out. My account is password protected.

Administrator User
* As an administrator, I would like to be able to log in and delete inappropriate content. I would also like to be able to view a list of recent posts with the registered user, topic and number of posts the user made.
