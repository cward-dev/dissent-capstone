## Planning Questions

# Dissent

Capstone project by Milan Stojanovic, Maria Bohnenstengel, and Chris Ward.

## Planning Questions

1. What are we going to use to keep track of our work? This must be done (Trello or Github Issues).
* Trello


2. How are we going to break down the problem? What specifically are we solving?
* Application will be broken-down into features (see UserStories), with each feature being approached and implemented vertically from back-end to front-end.


3. Do we have outstanding questions on what we are solving and do we have a plan to find those answers?
* TBD


4. What technologies will we need to solve our problem?
* What back-end frameworks do we need?
	* Java 11, Maven, Spring
* What database technology are we using?
	* MySQL
* What front-end frameworks do we need?
	* React.js
* How are we handling CSS?
	* Bootstrap


5. Do we need external resources (i.e. a 3rd party web API)
* Do we have the endpoints that we need documented?
* Do we know how we are going to access the resource? (Do we need an API key to leverage?)
  * NewsAPI (Free to register API key)
  * https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints
  * API Key: 46f374bc4801471fa5acc0956d739b7c



6. What dependencies do we have on breakout session material from this week?
* Do we need to wait for session material to become available?
	* User Validation / Roles+Management
* How are we going to gather the session material? Do we send 1 person, wait for recordings, or do we all need to go?
	* We will wait for recordings or reference lessons as needed.

7. What order are we developing features? What is part of the minimum viable product?
* Agile Approach (Vertical Slices)
  *

10. Are we using branching for our git repo?

TBD 


11. For each view, answer the following:
Do we have a diagram showing the view?
Do we show how the view is accessed? (i.e. what buttons must be clicked to get to the view)
Do we have it documented what data we will need to properly render the view?
Does that data correspond to a database table we have diagrammed (or a 3rd party service that we are using - make sure to document that as well)?
